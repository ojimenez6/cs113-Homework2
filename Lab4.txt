1.

	a. 
        	displayed n * n times. 
	
   	 	O(N^2)

        b. 
		displayed n * (n + 2) times. 
    		n * (n + 2) = n^2 + 2n
    
   	 	O(n^2). 

	c.      displayed (1/2) * n.length

		O(n^2)

	d.      displayed n * (n - 1)
                n * (n - 1) = n^2 - n

		O(n^2)


PROGRAMMING

1. Even though Y1 starts off with a higher output value, Y2 quickly outgrows it once n = 30. It makes 
   sense because Y1 is O(n) and Y2 is O(n^2).
